Maryam Yasamani Masouleh Project Proposal Biomechanical features of orthopedic patients Classifying patients based on six features Vertebral Column Data Set The data have been organized in two different but related classification tasks. The first task consists in classifying patients as belonging to one out of three categories: Normal (100 patients), Disk Hernia (60 patients) or Spondylolisthesis (150 patients). For the second task, the categories Disk Hernia and Spondylolisthesis were merged into a single category labelled as 'abnormal'. Thus, the second task consists in classifying patients as belonging to one out of two categories: Normal (100 patients) or Abnormal (210 patients) Each patient is represented in the data set by six biomechanical attributes derived from the shape and orientation of the pelvis and lumbar spine: pelvic incidence, pelvic tilt, lumbar lordosis angle, sacral slope, pelvic radius, grade of spondylolisthesis The original dataset was downloaded from UCI ML repository: Lichman, M. (2013). UCI Machine Learning Repository [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml]. Irvine, CA: University of California, School of Information and Computer Science Iâ€™m planning to use these biomechanical features to classify patients according to their labels with different methods (Logistic regression classification, SVM and KNN) in PYTHON and compare the results.
